# Dog Breed Classifier Using CNN
This repository contains a project that classifies dog breeds using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
The model is trained on a dataset of dog images and can predict the breed of a dog from an input image with high accuracy. 
The project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in image classification tasks.
